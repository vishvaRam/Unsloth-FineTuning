      "ground_truth": "Upon identifying a fraud, financial institutions are generally required to immediately set aside provisions for the entire fraudulent amount, encompassing deposit accounts. Adjustments to financial collateral can be made in accordance with Basel III regulatory frameworks. To lessen the effect on their quarterly earnings, banks are permitted to distribute these provisions over a period not exceeding four quarters, commencing from the quarter in which the fraud was discovered. Should the complete provisioning process extend beyond a single fiscal year, banks must debit the remaining un-provided sum from their 'other reserves' at the year-end. This entry is subsequently reversed in following quarters as the provisioning is finalized by debiting the profit and loss account. Mandatory disclosures include details on the total number of frauds, the financial amounts implicated, the provisions already established, and any unamortized provisions that have been debited from 'other reserves'.",

Should a project's completion be postponed due to factors outside the promoter's influence, the DCCO can be extended. This extension is not classified as a restructuring event if the new DCCO is set within two years of the initial DCCO for infrastructure projects, or within one year for non-infrastructure projects, provided that all other terms of the loan agreement remain unaltered. Such project loans are then considered standard assets and are subject to a standard asset provision of 0.40 percent.",

      "ground_truth": "The Provisioning Coverage Ratio (PCR) is a key metric that banks are required to maintain primarily to safeguard against potential loan losses. Its purpose is to enable banks to accumulate financial reserves during periods of profitability, which can then be utilized to absorb losses that may arise from non-performing assets during economic downturns. This practice is crucial for bolstering the stability of individual banking institutions and, consequently, the entire financial sector by ensuring that sufficient funds are allocated to cover expected credit losses.",

      "ground_truth": "When a bank revalues foreign currency denominated loans, specifically those originally disbursed in Indian Rupees, due to adverse exchange rate fluctuations, any revaluation loss must be recorded in the bank's Profit & Loss Account. Furthermore, the entire amount of any revaluation gain resulting from these foreign exchange movements should be utilized to establish provisions against the associated assets, in addition to the standard asset classification-based provisioning requirements.",
      "generated_answer": "When a bank revalues foreign currency denominated loans that are overdue and finds that the revaluation results in a gain, the bank must debit the 'Other Liabilities and Provisions' account with the amount of the gain. The bank should not recognize this gain as income. Conversely, if the revaluation results in a loss, the bank must credit the 'Other Liabilities and Provisions' account with the amount of the loss. This credit is in addition to any provisions already made for the loan.",

      "reasoning": "The model's answer incorrectly describes the accounting treatment of revaluation gains and losses. It states gains are debited to 'Other Liabilities and Provisions' and losses are credited, which is the opposite of the correct treatment.

Furthermore, existing holders of SGBs can later submit a request to convert their physical bonds into dematerialized form. The success of this conversion process is contingent upon the precise matching of the applicant's details, such as their name, Depository Participant (DP) ID, and Client ID, with the records held by the Depositories. Specifically, the investor's name registered on the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) portal must perfectly align with the information maintained by the Depositories. Following successful validation by the Depository, the Public Debt Office (PDO) Mumbai facilitates the transfer of these bonds to the Depository, which then credits them to the respective demat accounts. In cases where a conversion request is rejected, the Mumbai PDO of the RBI informs the Regional Offices (ROs) about the rejection, allowing for resubmission once the necessary corrections have been made.",

When the financial sum involved in a violation is less than Rupees one lakh, the compounding penalty is limited to the simple interest calculated on that sum for the duration of the violation. This interest is applied at a rate of 5% per annum for violations concerning reporting requirements and 10% per annum for all other types of violations. For violations specifically related to paragraph 8 of Schedule I to FEMA 20/2000 RB, an additional tiered assessment is applied, which considers scenarios involving share allotment and refunds occurring after 180 days. Any illicit profits or undue gains acquired by the party committing the violation may also be included in the final compounding penalty.

The variable penalty is determined by the duration of the violation and is calculated as a percentage of the amount under contravention; this percentage ranges from 0.050% for violations lasting less than one year to 0.075% for those lasting five years or more.

      "ground_truth": "When a loan is categorized as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), any interest that has accumulated and was previously recorded as income must be reversed, specifically the portion that has not yet been realized. However, for loans that included a moratorium on interest payments, if such a loan is classified as an NPA only after the moratorium period has concluded, the interest that was capitalized during that moratorium period is not required to be reversed.",
      "generated_answer": "When a loan is classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), any interest that has been accrued and previously credited to the income account must be reversed. This reversal should be done in a phased manner, starting with the interest that has accrued for more than 90 days past the due date, and continuing until the total amount of interest that was previously credited to the income account is fully reversed. For loans that have been granted a moratorium on interest payments, any interest that was accrued during the moratorium period should not be reversed.",

      "ground_truth": "For commercial banks, the reporting of reverse repo transactions within the Reserve Bank of India's Form A return follows specific guidelines based on the counterparty and the transaction's tenor. When engaging in reverse repo transactions with other banks, the reporting classification depends on the original duration: transactions with an original tenor of up to 14 days are to be reported under Item III(b) of Form A, titled 'Money at call and short notice,' and also under Memo item 2.1 of Annex A to Form A, designated 'Inter Bank Assets.' Conversely, reverse repo transactions with other banks that have an original tenor exceeding 14 days must be reported under Item III(c) of Form A, labeled 'Advances to banks,' and additionally under Memo items 2.1 and 2.2 of Annex A to Form A, both pertaining to 'Inter Bank Assets.' For reverse repo transactions conducted with non-bank entities, the reporting remains consistent irrespective of the transaction's tenor; these should be reported under Item VI(a) of Form A, which covers 'Loans, cash credits and overdrafts under Bank Credit in India, excluding inter-bank advances.'",
      "generated_answer": "Reverse repo transactions with banks are reported in Form A if the tenor is 14 days or less. However, if the tenor is more than 14 days, they are reported under Form A, Item VI(a), which covers loans, cash credits, and overdrafts under Bank Credit in India, excluding inter-bank advances. Reverse repo transactions with non-banks are reported in Form A, Item VI(b), which covers loans, cash credits, and overdrafts under Bank Credit in India, excluding inter-bank advances.",

      "ground_truth": "For a client's receivable originating from a derivative contract that becomes overdue for 90 days, the initial accounting step requires reversing any amount previously recognized in the Profit and Loss (P&L) account. This reversed amount should then be transferred to a 'Suspense Account-Crystallised Receivables'. Furthermore, if the derivative contracts permit future settlements and are not terminated despite the 90-day overdue status, any positive mark-to-market (MTM) valuation associated with these future receivables must also be reversed from the P&L account and placed into a dedicated 'Suspense Account – Positive MTM'. Subsequent increases in the MTM value should be credited to this 'Suspense Account – Positive MTM', while any decreases are to be adjusted against the existing balance. If the balance in the suspense account is insufficient to cover a decline, the remaining deficit should be debited to the P&L Account. Once the overdue amount is settled via cash payment, the corresponding balance held in the 'Suspense Account-Crystallised Receivables' can then be transferred back to the P&L account, proportionate to the payment received.",

      "ground_truth": "If a bank's lending exposure to a specific borrower is below 10% of the total exposure from the entire banking system to that borrower, then debits from the borrower's Cash Credit/Overdraft (CC/OD) account at that bank must exclusively be used to credit the CC/OD account of the same borrower held with a bank that possesses 10% or more of the total banking system exposure. Subsequently, funds are transferred to this designated CC/OD account at a predetermined frequency. Should a scenario arise where no single lender holds at least 10% of the total exposure, two main alternatives are available: either the funds can be directed to the borrower's account with the bank that has the largest individual share of the total exposure, or the borrower has the option to choose working capital demand loans or term loans and establish current accounts based on their aggregate exposure across all lenders.",
      "generated_answer": "When a bank's exposure to a borrower is less than 10% of the total banking system's exposure to that borrower, the bank is permitted to transfer the funds to another bank within the same system. This transfer is contingent upon the receiving bank's approval of the borrower's creditworthiness. Furthermore, if no single bank possesses the necessary exposure to meet the 10% threshold, the banks involved are obligated to establish a consortium arrangement. This arrangement necessitates the execution of a formal agreement that delineates the distribution of credit among the participating banks.",
